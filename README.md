This helps to show maintenance message for website or a specific page/ post. Maintenance message can be shown above contents as overlay or as a full page length maintenance mode.

## Description

Sometime we need to show some maintenance message for specific page or post. This is when we make some change on live content and dont want to show untill it is complete and ready to be live.

We can set maintenance mode for:

-   Whole website
-   Specific page
-   Specific post of any type
-   Can be set to show page without maintenance to user role when user is logged in. e.g. only admin can see page if maintenance is enabled.
